# Annie's Panner

Welcome to the GitHub page for **Annie's Panner**. It’s a standard 2.0 stereo panner made by JUCE.

It has zero revolutionary features. It moves sound left. It moves sound right.

So... I made a fancy demo video! 

Here is the video: https://youtu.be/f37XpFNmfMs?si=tBhxdTkuBHqExU_z
