## Modes

### Balance Mode

This mode moves the stereo image by controlling the volume balance between the left and right channels:

- At the center position, the original stereo content is unchanged  
- Panning left or right only attenuates the opposite channel  
- The original stereo width is preserved  



### Stereo Pan Mode

This mode redistributes energy between the left and right channels using a stereo matrix and equal-power calculation:

- The stereo image moves as a whole, with cross-mixing between channels  
- The spatial perception is more natural  

#### Auto Width

Inspired by the stereo pan in **Logic Pro**:

- The closer the sound is to the center, the wider the stereo image  
- The closer the sound is to the edges, the stereo width automatically narrows

It has zero revolutionary features.  
It moves sound left...  
It moves sound right...

If you are on macOS, you can download the AU and VST3 versions from the **Builds > macOS > build > Release** folder.
